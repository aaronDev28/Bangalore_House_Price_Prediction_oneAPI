# What It Does <img src= "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72274851/218503394-b52dfcc9-0620-4f44-94f5-46a09a5cc970.png" width="70" height="70">
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>Bengaluru House Prediction" is an advanced machine learning model that predicts the estimated home price based on various features such as square feet, bedroom, bathroom, location, and more. It follows a robust data science process, including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and k-fold cross-validation. The project is built on a Python Flask server that consumes the trained machine learning model and exposes HTTP endpoints for various requests. Additionally, it uses a pickle file to store the trained model.</p>
<h2>User Interface</h2>
<p>The project features a sleek and intuitive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input the necessary features and receive an instant price prediction. The user interface also provides various visualizations to help users understand the factors that influence the predicted price.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Bengaluru House Prediction is a powerful tool that can benefit potential homebuyers, real estate agents, and property developers. It empowers users with the right information to make informed decisions, negotiate better deals, and avoid overpaying. The project also demonstrates the power of data science in solving real-world problems and provides a robust framework for developing similar machine learning applications.</p>

- Real estate industry is complex and influenced by various factors, such as location, amenities, and market trends, which can be leveraged using machine learning to predict accurate prices.
- A robust data science process, including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and k-fold cross-validation, is necessary to build an accurate and efficient machine learning model.
- A user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can help users interact with the machine learning model and understand the factors that influence the predicted price.
- Python, Intel One API, Intel oneDAL, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Flask, Matplotlib, GridSearchCV, K-fold cross-validation, and Pickle are powerful tools and libraries used in developing machine learning models and web applications.
The project demonstrates the power of data science in solving real-world problems and provides a robust framework for developing similar machine-learning applications.

These are just a few examples of the knowledge and skills that i likely gained while building this project. 
Overall, building a price prediction application is a challenging and rewarding experience that requires a combination of technical expertise and real estate knowledge.
